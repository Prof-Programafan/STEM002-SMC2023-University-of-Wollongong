        <b>Primer Definition.</b>
        <i>
        <p>Users who wish to access the internet, are required to be connected in some way with their Internet Service Provider</p>
        <p>Being connected wired or wirelessly allows data (packets) to be transmitted between your device and the internet servers</i></p>

        <h2>Did you know?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fibre optics is the fastest wired broadband connection, with speeds up to 10 Gigabits per second (1 Gigabyte/sec);
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                5G network is the latest mobile network generation and has promising speeds of up to 1 Gigabit per second, which is impressive in wireless terms; 
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Such speeds allow new possibilities in the digital world which may solve existing problems in regards to latency such as selfdriving cars, remote concerts and conferencing;

        <h2>Types of Internet Connections</h2>

        <h3>Fibre Optics</h3>

        <p>Fibre optic cable use lazer lights hich is known for being the fastest to transmit data. Each pulse represents in binary once it has been converted to digital signals</p>

        <h3>Copper ADSL</h3>
        
        <img src="img/copperw.jpeg" height="250px" />

        <p>Copper wires are the most common connections, known as a ADSL line using existing telephone connections where each wire is in a twisted pair. Its outdated nature means its speed is annihilated by its future counterparts which use light instead of electricity</p>

        <h3>Wireless</h3>

        <p>Wireless mediums are possible especially in remote areas where cables cannot run for greater distances. <br />
            Using a satellite or transmission tower and a receiver, electromagnetic waves are sent among them. The receiver converts it into electrical signals for it to be useable by a router. </p>
