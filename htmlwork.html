        <b>Summary.</b>
        <i>
        <li>Hypertext Markup Language is the programming language used to develop documents that are readable by a web browser</li>
        <li>HTML incorporates assisting languages such as <b>Casscading Style Sheets</b> for design and <b>Javascript</b> on functionality</i></li>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2>What I have learnt</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The entire html document is specified by the HTML DOCTYPE Declaration</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li>lt;HTML&gt; starts off the contents inside the webpage and closes by the "&lt;/HTML&gt;" tag. Information in them forms the element of a webpage</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li>Through these demonstrations, brackets &lt;&gt; are mostly place to replicate HTML entity brackets </li>
            <br/><br/>

        </ul>
                <li>We must start off by establishing the container metadata of the webpage using the &lt;HEAD&gt; element, in which the browser will use.</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>We are then able to input CSS properties through &lt;style&gt; tags that affect the body content as well as Javascript functions.</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>Afterwards we open and close &lt;Body&gt; tags to establish the Body element, allowing content to be displayed in the browser.</li>
                <br/><br/>
            </ul>
            
        <ul>
            <li>We made tables that allowed text and media to be filled in them. We start off by opening the &lt;table&gt; element in which we define the alignment, dimensions and borders as shown below/</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li> &lt;table border="0" which specifies the size of borders align="center" which positions the table within the page&gt;</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li>&lt;tr&gt; elements would follow for every cell row there is, opened and closed off by its &lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; tags</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li>For each column, &lt;td&gt; elements are applied which in them can have information for displaying media such as images or text. Automatically the cell is adjusted for new text.</li>
            <br/><br/>

        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Speaking of images, &lt;img&gt; elements are used to display them, which works similar to table elements</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li >&lt;img src="file name.fmt/directory" height="<i>measured in pixels</i>"</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li>Files are loaded from the same folder the HTML file is loaded, so if there isn't, the complete directory should be inputted for the browser to understand and load</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li>Hyperlinks to webpages within your local storage or external websites are possible thanks to the <i>a href</i> attribute</b></li>
            For example:
            <li>&lt;A Href="name.html/external URL"&gt;</li>
            Between such elements allows text to be written whilst being interactive.
        </ul>

        <h2>What I have learnt</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Using Href attributes, multiple webpages were linked to each other</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>For example the square image has become a clickable link to a page displaying properties of the Square</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <video width="500px" height="500px" controls>
                    <source src="img/Untitled.mov" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                  </video>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>Similar to the image element, this video element renders my demonstration of hyperlinks through a screen recording
                    <br/><br/>
                &lt;video width="sizepx" height="sizepx" controls&gt;
                    &lt;source src="file.fmt" type="video/fmt"&gt;
                    &lt;/video&gt;
                    <br/><br/></li>                  
                </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>As you can see, there are headings and subtitles throughout the page.</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>For developing the Square heading, the &lt;h1&gt; tags allows the heading 1 style to be shown. The text should be between the opening and closing tags as &lt;h1&gt;.</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>Likewise subheadings would follow by stylising the &lt;h2&gt; tags and entering the text in between. This was followed by images done by the image element source and specifing the ideal size.</li>
                <br/><br/>
            </ul>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Listing was also done through the list element &lt;ul&gt; due to unordinal forms</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>Followed &lt;li&gt; tags that would form the bullet points for each line of text.</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>The list set must be closed to make a new one or to end it which also requires the closing &lt;/ul&gt; tags</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <img src="img/dots.png" height="200px">
                <br/><br/>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>As HTML can't recognise special characters by simply putting inserting them into text, a hexadecimal reference code allows them to be displayed on the browser </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>For example: & # 1 2 9 4 0 9 ; translates into the &#129409; emoji</li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>Special characters such as the entity tags &lt;&gt; are displayed by hexademical reference & # l t; and & # g t ; </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>Therefore each character including regular letters for code have their own references but being it common means translation for them so that each character doesn't need the tediousness of locating its hexadecimal reference
